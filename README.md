# WordMasterKMP

![kotlin-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-2.4.10-blue?logo=kotlin)

Kotlin Multiplatform sample heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game and also [Word Master](https://github.com/octokatherine/word-master) and [wordle-solver](https://github.com/dlew/wordle-solver) samples.  The main game logic/state is included in shared KMP code with basic UI then in following clients
- iOS (SwiftUI)
- Android (Jetpack Compose)
- Desktop (Compose for Desktop)

### Shared KMP game logic/state

The shared `WordMasterService` class exposes the game state as `StateFlow`s:

```
val boardGuesses = StateFlow<ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>>()       // letters entered on each row
val boardStatus  = StateFlow<ArrayList<ArrayList<LetterStatus>>>() // per-letter result
val keyStatus    = StateFlow<Map<String, LetterStatus>>()          // best status per key, colours the keyboard
val guessError   = StateFlow<String?>()                            // validation feedback
```

Each client renders a board of read-only tiles plus an on-screen keyboard. Key presses call
`WordMasterService.addLetter()` / `removeLetter()`, and `submitGuess()` validates the row against the
word list (surfacing "Not enough letters" / "Not in word list" via `guessError`) before evaluating it
and updating the flows above.  The Compose clients observe state as following (with any updates to those
`StateFlow`'s triggering recomposition)

```
val boardStatus by wordMasterService.boardStatus.collectAsState()
val keyStatus by wordMasterService.keyStatus.collectAsState()
```


On iOS we're using the [KMP-NativeCoroutines](https://github.com/rickclephas/KMP-NativeCoroutines) library to map the `StateFlow` to Swift `AsyncSequence`.  So, for example, our Swift view model includes

```
@Published public var boardStatus: [[LetterStatus]] = []
@Published public var boardGuesses: [[String]] = []
```

which are then updated using for example

```
let stream = asyncSequence(for: wordMasterService.boardStatus)
for try await data in stream {
  self.boardStatus = data as! [[LetterStatus]]
}

let stream = asyncSequence(for: wordMasterService.boardGuesses)
for try await data in stream {
    self.boardGuesses = data as! [[String]]
}

```

Any updates to `boardStatus` or `boardGuesses` will trigger our SwiftUI UI to be recomposed again.
